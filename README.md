## Simple Weather API Project Description

The Weather API is a service, which is able to deliver weather forecast data for any given location on earth. The app is created with create-react-app.
This project get the weather data of a city from openweathermap.

### `Features`

Just enter the city name and you'll get following data:

- Weather type
- Celsius degrees

### `Supported languages`

- English only

### `Future Features`

Right now it has 3 components filled out with CSS animations. Each of them will represent different weather conditions, let's say it's 26 degrees and clear sky in Manila, you'll only see the middle component. Now I'd like to see what's the weather like in London, it's around 4 degrees, heavy rain & lightning - in that case you'll see the third component only that represent sort of "end of the world".
